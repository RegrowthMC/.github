# RegrowthMC
RegrowthMC is a public Minecraft server focused on community, whilst we will always try to implement unique features, at the heart our focus is giving players a great community and server to engage in/with.

## Community
- Join the [Discord server](https://regrowthmc.net/discord) to join the community and Minecraft server
- Support the project by donating to our [store](https://store.regrowthmc.net/)

## Open Source
We have opted to make many of our plugins open-source for multiple reasons:

- **Knowledge Sharing:** Open-source projects are a great place to allow us to learn from others and for others to learn from us!
- **Community Engagement:** By allowing the community to see our code we open the door for others to provide feedback, suggestions, help identify bugs and improve the performance of our plugins.
- **Improvement:** Whilst we are not accepting feature suggestions for the plugins we are always open to allowing developers to make code improvements without also having to devote their free time to developing for the server.

## Contributing
If you'd like to help improve any of our projects you are more than welcome to! Please make sure to follow our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/RegrowthMC/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md), more project specific guidelines may be outlined within the individual repositories.
